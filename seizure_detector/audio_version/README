README - Audio Version of Seizure Detector
==========================================

This is an attempt to make a reliable seizure detector based on audio sensing.
We can detect either breathing - looking for abnormal breathing patterns, or
the sounds of the shaking movement.

I am working on an initial feasibility study using a PC microphone to 
seprate hardware problems from software ones - I know the PC hardware works!

Once I think it is feasible, I will transfer it to an Arduino.
