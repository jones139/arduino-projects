Seizure_Detector
================

This project is intended as an alarm to warn a carer if someone they are
looking after suffers an epileptic seizure (fit).
It is based on an accelerometer monitoring movement.  It uses a fourier
transform to extract the frequency spectrum of the movement, and monitors
movements in a given frequency band.   The idea is that it will detect the
rhythmic movements associated with a seizure, but not normal day to day
activities.

If the acceleration within the given frequency band is more than a
threshod value, it starts a timer.  If the acceleration remains above
the threshold for a given period, it issues a warning beep.
If it remains above the threshold for a longer specified period, the unit
alarms (continuous tone rather than beep).

This is a development version so it contains a real time clock and SD card
to record the measured spectra to help optimise the device.

My initial intention is to mount this on a floor board on which our son
sleeps (he will not sleep in a bed...).  It may not be sensitive enough to
pick up the movement through the floor, so it may have to be turned into a 
wearable device.

If it still does not work, I will develop a cctv camera based one instead,
but that will need more processing power than an arduino.
