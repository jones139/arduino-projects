Various libraries that I either have updated (from others) or created myself.

Download and copy the desired lib to your Arduino libraries folder. The default locations for these are:
On your Mac:: In (home directory)/Documents/Arduino/libraries
On your PC:: My Documents -> Arduino -> libraries
On your Linux box:: (home directory)/sketchbook/libraries

You may need to create the "libraries" subfolder if you haven't done so already.

See each lib for it's License.
