Soil Moisture Meter Test
========================

5V supply, connected to analogue input pin.

Open Circuit in air:  1023 counts.
Held between dry fingers: 1014 counts.

Fully inserted into damp compost 295 rising to 300, then falls to 174.

Add water to saturate compost (first drain from pot).  Rose initially to ~208
Added more water to make sure it is saturated.   Rose to 265.
Left for an hour....It settled out at 182 - very close to just damp compost.

So maybe it is only good to detect dry or damp and not damp or saturated....
